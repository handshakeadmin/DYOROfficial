- Detects sequence errors

## Certificate of Analysis (COA)

A legitimate COA should include:

1. **Product identification** - Name, lot number, synthesis date
2. **Purity data** - HPLC chromatogram and percentage
3. **MS data** - Expected vs. observed mass
4. **Appearance** - Physical description
5. **Solubility** - Recommended solvents

## Storage Considerations

Proper storage is essential for maintaining peptide integrity:

- **Temperature**: Most peptides require -20°C or colder
- **Light protection**: Store in amber vials or dark conditions
- **Moisture**: Use desiccants and sealed containers
- **Reconstitution**: Use appropriate sterile solvents

## Quality Indicators

When evaluating a peptide supplier, consider:

- Third-party testing availability
- Batch-specific COAs
- Transparent manufacturing processes
- Proper cold-chain shipping
- Consistent lot-to-lot quality

**Remember**: Quality peptides are essential for valid research. Always verify purity before beginning experiments.
